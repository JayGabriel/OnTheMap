# OnTheMap
Built an app that posts user-generated location information to a shared map, pulling the locations of fellow Nanodegree students, with custom messages about themselves or their learning experience.

## How to use
This app can be run on a device running iOS 10.0 or higher. In order to use this app, you must have an active Udacity student account. Login using your Udacity credentials. From there you can view student-set locations as well as student-defined URLs in a table and on a map view.
